First, we import the pyshorteners library, which provides a simple interface for shortening URLs using various URL shortening services.
We create an instance of the Shortener class and store it in the shortener variable.
We prompt the user to enter a long URL using the input() function and store it in the long_link variable.
We use the shortener.tinyurl.short(long_link) method to shorten the long URL. The tinyurl service is one of the many URL shortening services supported by the pyshorteners library.
Finally, we print the shortened URL stored in the short_link variable.
